\section{Introduction}
Geodetic observations of surface deformation in the months to years
following an earthquake are often attributed to afterslip
\citep[e.g.][]{M1991}, viscoelastic relaxation in the lithosphere
\citep[e.g.][]{NM1974}, and/or poroelastic-relaxation
\citep[e.g.][]{P1998,J2003}.  If postseismic deformation can be
entirely described by afterslip, then one could easily constrain the
spatial distribution of fault slip with a linear least squares
inversion \citep[e.g.][]{H1987,B2002,F2007}, which could then provide
insight into the frictional properties of faults
\citep[e.g.][]{H2006,B2009}.  However, postseismic deformation
following large (Mw$\geq$7) earthquakes is often attributed to
viscoelastic relaxation in the lithosphere
\citep[e.g.][]{HH2003,P2003,P2005} or a combination of both afterslip
and viscoelastic relaxation \citep[e.g.][]{F2006,H2008,J2009,R2015}.
In such cases, postseismic deformation can be used to constrain the
viscous properties of the lithosphere, although this is a more
difficult task than constraining a slip distribution.  Not only are
there potentially competing deformation mechanism which must be
discerned, finding the viscosity distribution of the lithopshere from
postseimsic deformation is a computationally expensive nonlinear
inverse problem.  Typically, this is approached with a forward
modeling, grid search method.  These forward modeling techniques
require the number of unknown parameters being estimated to be small,
meaning that significant and potentially inappropriate modeling
assumptions must be made \citep{RG2008,H2013}.

In this paper we propose a relatively fast method to kinematically
invert coseismic and postseismic deformation to simultaneously
estimate a time-dependent distribution of fault slip and an
arbitrarily discretized viscosity structure of the lithosphere.  Our
method is based on an approximation which linearizes the rate of early
postseismic deformation with respect to the viscosity of the
lithosphere.  We demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of our
method through a synthetic test.

\section{Linearizing early postseismic deformation} 
We assume that the lithosphere can be approximated as a Maxwell
viscoelastic material on the timescales of postseismic deformation,
where shear stress and strain are related by
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial\mitbf{\varepsilon}}{\partial t}=\frac{\mitbf{\sigma}}{2\eta} + 
                              \frac{1}{2\mu}\frac{\partial\mitbf{\sigma}}{\partial t}.
\end{equation}
$\eta$ and $\mu$ are viscosity and shear modulus, respectively.  This
constitutive relationship implies that a sudden strain in the
lithosphere from an earthquake will instantaneously propagate stresses
through the lithosphere elastically (assuming the lithosphere is
undergoing quasi-static deformation).  Creep will also initiate
immediately after the earthquake, where the initial viscous strain
rate in each parcel of the lithosphere will be proportional to the
fluidity ($\varphi=1/\eta$) in that parcel, and independent of the
fluidity elsewhere, as stress at this time is only controlled by the
elastic properties.  Each parcel will continue to creep at
approximately that rate for as long as the initial elastic stresses
from the earthquake are large compared to the stresses transferred
throughout the lithosphere by viscoelastic relaxation.  In this early
postseismic period, creep in each parcel will express itself as
surface deformation with an amplitude that is also proportional to the
fluidity in that parcel and independent of the fluidity elsewhere.
The early surface expression of creep in the entire lithosphere is
therefore a sum of the surface expression of each parcel and is linear
with respect to lithospheric fluidity.  This property of early
postseismic surface deformation is demonstrated below using simple
infinite length, strike-slip earthquake models, where the lithosphere
is approximated as a layered halfspace.  The linearity of
postseismic deformation with respect to fluidity to greatly
facilitates the inverse problem of estimating lithospheric viscosity.

\subsection{Two-dimensional earthquake models}
The easiest way to demonstrate how postseismic deformation can be
linearized with respect to lithospheric viscosity is with a simple
two-dimensional earthquake model consisting of a long, vertical,
surface rupturing, strike-slip fault that is embedded in a
viscoelastic horizontal layer overlying a viscoelastic halfspace.  We
make use of the correspondence principle of viscoelasticity
\citep[e.g.][]{F1975}, which states that the Laplace transform of
deformation in a viscoelastic body has the same form as the Laplace
transform of deformation in a elastic body with the same geometry and
subjected to the same boundary conditions. The solution for
displacements following an earthquake in a viscoelastic lithosphere
can then be easily found provided that the corresponding elastic
solution is known \citep[e.g.][]{NM1974,SP1978,HH2005}.  One only
needs to replace the shear modulus in the Laplace transform of the
elastic solution with the effective viscoelastic shear modulus and
then compute the inverse Laplace transform.

\subsubsection{Two layered model}
From the solution of \citet{R1971}, surface displacements,
$u_{e}(x,t)$, resulting from slip on a fault in an elastic surface
layer overlying a semi-infinite elastic substrate are
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerElastic}
  u_{e}(x,t) = b(t)\left(\frac{1}{2} W(0) + 
    \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Gamma^nW(n)\right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  W(n) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2nH + D}{x}\right) 
    - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2nH - D}{x}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\mu_1 + \mu_2}.
\end{equation}
In the above equation, $b(t)$ describes cummulative slip on the fault
through time and can describe coseismic slip and/or afterslip. $D$ is
the locking depth of the fault, $H$ is the thickness of the upper
layer, and $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the shear modulii in the upper
layer and lower substrate, respectively.  The Laplace transform of eq
(\ref{TwoLayerElastic}) is
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerElasticLaplace}
 \hat{u}_e(x,s) = \hat{b}(s)\left(\frac{1}{2} W(0) +\sum_{n=1}^\infty\Gamma^nW(n)\right).
\end{equation}
We replace $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ in eq. \ref{TwoLayerElasticLaplace}
with the equivalent shear modulii for Maxwell materials in the Laplace
domain, $\hat{\mu}_1$ and $\hat{\mu}_2$, to get the Laplace
transform of surface displacements in the two-layered, viscoelastic
half-space,
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerViscousLaplace}
 \hat{u}_v(x,s) = \hat{b}(s)\left(\frac{1}{2}W(0) +\sum_{n=1}^\infty\hat{\Gamma}^nW(n)\right),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Gamma} = \frac{\hat{\mu_1} - \hat{\mu_2}}{\hat{\mu_1} + \hat{\mu_2}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mu_i} = \frac{s}{\frac{s}{\mu_i} + \frac{1}{\eta_i}}.
\end{equation}
To find the surface displacements in the time domain one must find the
inverse Lapace transform of eq (\ref{TwoLayerViscousLaplace}), which
is typically done using the method of residues. However, we are interested in characterizing
the behavior of early postseismic deformation and it better serves us
to instead perform the inverse Laplace transform with an extension of
the initial value theorem (Appendix A). We assume for simplicity that
the shear modulus for the viscoelastic lithosphere is homogenous
(i.e. $\mu_1 = \mu_2$) and demonstrate in a supplementary IPython
notebook that our conclusions still hold when $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$.  The
surface displacements in the time domain are
\begin{equation}
 u_v(x,t) = b(t)\frac{1}{2}W(0) + 
            b(t)\ast\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\sum_{n=1}^\infty\hat{\Gamma}^{n}W(n)\right].
\end{equation}
Evaluating the above inverse Laplace transform using the method
described in Appendix A, we find 
\begin{align}\label{TwoLayerViscous}
  u_v(x,t) = &b(t)\frac{1}{2}W(0) +\nonumber\\
             &b(t)\ast\left(\frac{\mu}{2\eta_2}W(1) - \frac{\mu}{2\eta_1}W(1)\right) +\nonumber\\
             &b(t)\ast\left(\left(\frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_2^2} -
                  \frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_1\eta_2}\right) \left(W(1) - W(2)\right) +
                  \left(\frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_1\eta_2} - \frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_1^2}\right)
                  \left(W(1) + W(2)\right)\right) + \nonumber\\ 
             &\dots.
\end{align}
The first term in eq (\ref{TwoLayerViscous}) is the elastic response
to slip on the fault.  The remaining terms describe the surface
displacement due to viscoelastic relaxation.  The first of these
remaining terms is the initial viscoelastic response and, as
suggested, it is a linear expression with respect to the fluidity in
each of the two layers.

If the time since the rupture is sufficiently small compared to the
relaxation times of each layer, $\tau_i=\eta_i/\mu$, (i.e. the third
and following terms in eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscous}) are small), then we
can truncate the series and approximate early surface deformation
using only the elastic response and the initial viscoelastic response,
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerViscousApprox}
 u_v(x,t) \approx b(t)\frac{1}{2}W(0) + 
          \int_0^t b(\theta)\left(\frac{\mu}{2\eta_2}W(1) - 
                  \frac{\mu}{2\eta_1}W(1)\right)d\theta.
\end{equation} 
An approximation similar to eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) was
demonstrated by \citet{S2010} for an elastic layer over a Maxwell
viscoelastic substrate.  

Figure 1 shows the series solution from eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscous})
truncated at a sufficiently large $N$ along with the approximation
given by eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}). In this comparison, we use
$H=15$ km, $D=10$ km and a shear modulus of 32.0 GPa throughout the
lithosphere.  The upper layer is given a viscosity of $10^{20}$ Pa s
($\tau\approx 100$ years) and the substrate is given a viscosity of
$10^{19}$ Pa s ($\tau=10$ years).  We let b(t) describe a unit of
instantaneous slip at $t=0.0$.  We find the that the approximate
solution is a good representation to the series solution for at least
as long as half the lowest of the two relaxation time, regardless of
our choice of model parameters.  The approximation breaks down faster
than what is show in Figure 1 when the upper layer is weaker than the
substrate or when we decrease the depth of the material interface
(i.e. when the weaker material is closer to the fault).  We also note
that the approximation has more longevity for locations further away
from the fault, where it starts to break down at about
$\text{min}(\tau_i)$.

It is worth noting that the initial viscoelastic response for the
uppermost layer and lower half-space differ only in sign and in
amplitude.  In the context of an inverse problem, this means that it
is impossible to use (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) to estimate the
absolute viscosity of the two layers, rather it is only possible to
estimate their relative viscosities.  This is not a difficult obstacle
to overcome because in application we can typically assume that the
upper layer has a sufficiently long Maxwell relaxation time such that
it is effectively elastic over the postseismic period.

\subsubsection{Three layered model}
We follow the same procedure from above to find the surface
deformation resulting from slip on a strike-slip fault in a three
layered viscoelastic half-space.  Starting from the layered elastic
solution from \citet{CJ1972}, we evalutate the solution for the
viscoelastic problem in our supplementary ipython notebook. Once
again, we find that the initial viscoelastic response is linear with
respect to the fluidity in each of the three layers and we can approximate
early postseismic deformation resulting from slip described by $b(t)$
as
\begin{equation}\label{ThreeLayerViscousApprox}
u_v(x,t) \approx b(t)\frac{1}{2} W(0,0) + 
         \int_0^tb(\theta)\left(\frac{\mu}{2\eta_3}W(1,1)
                               +\frac{\mu}{2\eta_2}(W(0,1) - W(1,1))
                               -\frac{\mu}{2\eta_1}W(0,1)\right)d\theta,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  W(n,m) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2nH_2 + 2mH_1 + D}{x}\right) - 
                              \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2nH_2 + 2mH_1 - D}{x}\right)\right),
\end{equation}
$\eta_1$, $\eta_2$, and $\eta_3$ are the viscosities of the top,
middle, and bottom layers, respectively, and $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the
thicknesses of the top and middle layer, respectively.  We can see
that eq. (\ref{ThreeLayerViscousApprox}) recovers eq.
(\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) when $\eta_3 = \eta_2$.

\subsubsection{Continuous depth dependent model}
At this point we posit that a similar approximation can be made for an
arbitrarily layered lithosphere. In Appendix B we use
eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) to find an initial viscoelastic
response kernel.  We then integrate that kernel over the depth of the
lithosphere to find the initial viscoelastic response for an arbitrary
depth dependent viscosity structure.  If the lithsophere is elastic
above the fault depth, $D$, and described by $\eta(z)$ below $D$ then
early postseismic deformation can be approximated as
\begin{equation}\label{ContinuousViscousApprox}
u(x,t) \approx \frac{b(t)}{\pi}\tan^{-1}(\frac{D}{x}) + 
               \int_o^t\int_D^\infty \frac{\mu b(\theta)}{2\pi\eta(z)}
                                    \left(\frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(D + 2z\right)^2} - 
                                    \frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(2z - D\right)^2}\right)
                                    dz d\theta.
\end{equation}
Although the above equation is capable of describing surface
deformation for an arbitrary depth dependent viscosity structure, it
falls short of being useful as the forward solution in an inverse
problem aimed at estimating lithospheric viscosity.  This shortcoming
is because the above equation makes the unphysical assumption that the
fault is infinitely long, in addition to the restriction of only being
applicable to a vertical strike-slip fault.  The assumption of
infinite length would introduce first order errors, which would likely
wash out the second order effect of viscosity. However,
eq. (\ref{ContinuousViscousApprox}) is useful for making estimates of
the depth sensitivity of postseismic deformation.

\subsection{arbitrarily discretized earthquake models}
Motivated by our above results, we make the assertion that the initial
rate of surface deformation resulting from an instantaneous
dislocation in a three-dimensional Maxwell viscoelastic
medium, which has been arbitrarily discretized into $N$ regions, will
have the form
\begin{equation}\label{PostseismicInitialVelocity}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\vec{u}(\vec{x},t)\big|_{t=0} = \sum_j^N\frac{1}{\eta_j}G_j(\vec{x}).
\end{equation}
We denote $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{x}$ as vectors to emphasize that
eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}) is generalized to
three-dimensional problems.  We use $G_j(\vec{x})$ to represent the
initial rate of surface deformation at position $\vec{x}$ resulting
from viscoelastic creep in region $j$ with unit fluidity, where
fluidity is zero (i.e. elastic) in all other regions.  In this sense,
$G_j(x)$ can be thought of as a Green's function for the initial rate
of surface deformation resulting for viscoelastic deformation, and
thus we refer to $G_j(x)$ as the initial viscoelastic Green's
function.  We verify eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity})
numerically in section 5.5 and save a theoretical justification for a
later paper.

Using eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}), we can then approximate
early surface deformation as
\begin{equation}\label{intermediate}
\vec{u}(\vec{x},t) \approx b(t)F(\vec{x}) + \sum_j^N\int_0^t
\frac{b(\theta)}{\eta_j}G_j(\vec{x}) d\theta,
\end{equation}
where $F(x)$ is the elastic Green's function, which describes the
elastic deformation resulting from a dislocation. We further
generalize the approximation of surface deformation in
eq. (\ref{intermediate}) to allow for an arbitrary spatial
distribution of slip by using linear superposition.  If the elastic
defomation in a viscoelastic lithosphere can be described in terms of
$M$ elastic dislocation sources, then early surface deformation
resulting from both elastic dislocations and viscous creep can be
approximated as
\begin{equation}\label{Postseismic_Approximation}
\vec{u}(\vec{x},t) \approx \sum_i^Mb_i(t)F_i(\vec{x}) +
\sum_i^M\sum_j^N\int_0^t\frac{b_i(\theta)}{\eta_j}G_{ij}(\vec{x}) d\theta.
\end{equation}
The initial viscoelastic Green's function is dependent upon both the
region it represents as well as the dislocation source which induces
the viscoelastic creep in that region, hence the two indices.  It is
worth restating that the approximation given above does not account
for the viscoelastic coupling between the regions, since each region's
contribution to surface deformation is independent of the viscosity
elsewhere in eq.(\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}).  This approximation
is therfore appropriate for as long as the regions do not
significantly transfer stresses between eachother through viscoelastic
deformation.

\section{Inversion method}
The approximation of postseismic deformation given by eq.
(\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) can be cast as an inverse problem
aimed at finding the distribution of slip on a fault and an
arbitrarily complicated lithosphere viscosity structure from
postseismic deformation. We assume that the slip history in any one
direction on each fault patch, $b_i(t)$, can be expressed as $P$ linear
terms such that
\begin{equation}
  b_i(t) = \sum_k^P \alpha_{ik}A_k(t),
\end{equation}
where $A_k(t)$ consists of either step functions describing coseismic
slip on a fault patch, or ramp functions, which have nonzero slope
over a time interval and are intended to represent afterslip.
$\alpha_{ik}$ then represents either the amount of coseismic slip of
the cumulative slip over a time interval.  The approximation given by
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) now becomes
\begin{equation}\label{Postseismic_Approximation2}
  \vec{u}(\vec{x},t) \approx
  \sum_i^M\sum_k^P\alpha_{ik}F_i(\vec{x})A_k(t) +
  \sum_i^M\sum_j^N\sum_k^P\int_0^t\frac{\alpha_{ik}}{\eta_j}G_{ij}(\vec{x})A_k(\theta)d\theta.
\end{equation}
If we assume a fault geometry and the elastic properties of the
lithosphere, $F_i(\vec{x})$ can be computed with finite element
software or with an analytical solution
\citep[e.g.][]{O1992,M2007}. Likewise, $G_{ij}(\vec{x})$ can be
computed using finite element software.  If the assumed geometry of
the viscoelastic regions is sufficiently simple, $G_{ij}(\vec{x})$ may
also be computed with semi-analytic techniques
\citep[e.g.][]{P1997,FM2006,BF2010}.

We estimate the unknown slip parameters, $\alpha_{ik}$, and unknown
viscosities in each region of the lithosphere, $\eta_j$ from
observations of surface deformation in a least squares sense. Let
$\mitbf{u_{obs}}$ be a vector of observed coseismic and postseismic
surface displacements at various locations and points in time.  Let
$\mitbf{m}$ be a vector of all the unknown parameters $\alpha_{ik}$
and $\eta_j$ with length $Q=M+N+P$, and let $\mitbf{u(m)}$ be a vector
of postseismic surface displacements predicted by eq
(\ref{Postseismic_Approximation2}). We seek to solve
\begin{equation}\label{Inverse_Problem}
  \mathrm{min}
  \big|\big|\mitbf{f(m)}\big|\big|_2^2
\end{equation}
subject to the constraint that
\begin{equation}
  \mitbf{m}\geq0,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  \mitbf{f(m)} = 
    \begin{vmatrix}
      \mitbf{W}\left(\mitbf{u(m)}-\mitbf{u}_{\mathrm{obs}}\right)\\
      \mitbf{Lm}\\
    \end{vmatrix} .
\end{equation}  
In the above equation, $\mitbf{W}$ is a diagonal matrix containing the
reciprocal of the data uncertainties
(i.e. $\mitbf{W}^T\mitbf{W}=\mitbf{C_d}^{-1}$ where $\mitbf{C_d}$ is
the data covariance matrix), and $\mitbf{L}$ is a regularization matrix.

We impose a nonnegativity constraint on $\mitbf{m}$ which ensures that
inferred slip is in one predominant direction and that viscosities are
postive.  Specifically, the rake of the inferred slip on each fault
patch is to be within a $90^\circ$ window defined by the rakes of
chosen orthogonal basis slip directions. For instance, the basis slip
directions could be chosen such that only slip rakes within $45^\circ$
of pure strike-slip, normal, or thrust are permisible.

Because this inverse problem inevitably has nonunique solutions for
$\mitbf{m}$, we put additional constraints on the model parameters with
the matrix $\mitbf{L}$.  In our following synthetic tests, we constrain
the solution by minimizing the Laplacian of the spatial distribution
of fault slip and lithospheric viscosity.  We do so by letting
$\mitbf{L}$ be the umbrella operator \citep{D1999} such that
\begin{equation}
  \sum_j^{Q}L_{ij}m_j = \frac{\lambda_i}{|\mathcal{N}(i)|}\sum_{k\in \mathcal{N}(i)} m_k - m_i,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denotes the set of indices for model parameters
describing slip (viscosity) which is adjacent to the slip (viscosity)
described by $m_i$ and $|\mathcal{N}(i)|$ is the length of that
set. $\lambda_i$ is a penalty parameter which controls how much we
enforce the smoothness constraint.  The subscript in $\lambda_i$ is
included because we find a seperate penalty parameter for coseismic
slip, afterlip, and viscosity model pararameters.  The optimal penalty
parameters are chosen using 10-fold cross validation.

We find $\mitbf{m}$ that satisfies the above conditions using the
Gauss-Newton method \citep[e.g.][]{A2013}.  The best fit model parameters are
found by making an initial guess for the solution and then iteratively
solving
\begin{equation}\label{Gauss-Newton}
\mitbf{J}(\mitbf{m}^{k})\mitbf{m}^{k+1} = -\mitbf{f}(\mitbf{m}^k) + \mitbf{J}(\mitbf{m}^{k})\mitbf{m}^{k}
\end{equation}
for $\mitbf{m}^{k+1}$.  $\mitbf{J}(\mitbf{m}^k)$ is the Jacobian of
$\mitbf{f(m)}$ with respect to $\mitbf{m}$ evaluated at
$\mitbf{m^k}$. We impose the nonnegativity constraint on $\mitbf{m}$
by solving eq (\ref{Gauss-Newton}) with a nonnegative least squares
algoritm \citep{LH1974}. We find that it is occasionally necessary to
constrain the step size for each iteration of eq. (\ref{Gauss-Newton})
in order to ensure convergence.  We do so in a manner akin to the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm \citep[e.g.][]{A2013}.  We instead solve
\begin{equation}\label{Levenberg-Marquardt}
  \mitbf{J^*}(\mitbf{m}^k)\mitbf{m}^{k+1} = -\mitbf{f^*}(\mitbf{m}^k) + \mitbf{J^*}(\mitbf{m}^k)\mitbf{m}^k
\end{equation}
for $m^{k+1}$, where
\begin{equation}
  \mitbf{J^*}(\mitbf{m}) = 
      \begin{vmatrix}
      \mitbf{J}(\mitbf{m})\\
      \kappa\mitbf{I}
      \end{vmatrix},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \mitbf{f^*}(\mitbf{m}) = 
      \begin{vmatrix}
      \mitbf{f}(\mitbf{m})\\
      \mitbf{0}
      \end{vmatrix},
\end{equation}
and $\kappa$ controls the step size for each iteration and varies
depending on whether the algorithm is converging.  

In a nonlinear least squares algorithm, computing the Jacobian
typically is the largest computational burden; however, in this case
evaluating the Jacobian of eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation2})
requires only a few computationally inexpensive matrix operations.
Consequently, our nonlinear least squares algorithm converges to a
solution for $\mitbf{m}$ in a matter of seconds on a desktop computer.
The main computational burden is in computing $F_i(x)$ and $G_{ij}(x)$
which is done with finite element software and only needs to be done
once for a given fault and lithosphere geometry. Throughout this
paper, our initial guess for the model parameters is that there is no
slip on any fault patch, and the lithosphere is entirely elastic
($1/\eta = 0$).  In our experience, the choice of initial guess has an
insignificant effect on the best fit solution.

\section{Synthetic test}
\subsection{Synthetic postseismic deformation}

We demonstrate with a synthetic test that our inverse method is
capable of recovering fault slip and lithospheric viscosity from
postseismic deformation.  We use the finite element software, Pylith
\citep{A2007}, to compute the surface deformation resulting from a
specified amount of slip on a fault in a lithosphere with a specified
viscosity.  We invert this synthetic surface deformation using the
method described above to recover the imposed model parameters.  The
synthetic test also serves to demonstrate that
eqs. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}) and
(\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) are indeed valid for three
dimensional earthquake models.

Our synthetic model consists of a 50 km long by 20 km wide strike-slip
fault, striking to the north and dipping $60^{\circ}$ to the east (figure
4). At $t=0.0$ we impose $6.54*10^{19}$ N m of surface rupturing,
right-lateral coseismic slip with a distribution shown in Figure 2.
After the coseismic slip, we impose a constant rate of afterslip from
$t=0.0$ to $t=0.5$ years.  The cumulative seismic moment over this
interval is about $1.07*10^{19}$ N m.  The spatial distribution of
afterslip is shown in Figure 2.  During the interval $t=0.5$ to
$t=1.0$, years the rate of afterslip is decreased by a factor of 2.
From $t=1.0$ year onward, we do not impose any fault slip.

The lithosphere in our synthetic model is Maxwell viscoelastic with
homogenous Lam\'e parameters $\lambda = 32.0$ GPa and $\mu = 32.0$
GPa.  The viscosity in the lithosphere decays from $10^{21}$ Pa s
($\tau\approx1,000$ years) at the surface to $10^{19}$ Pa s
($\tau\approx10$ years) at 75 km depth (Figure 3).  We compute
displacements at 0.1 year intervals up until $t=10$ years, which makes
the upper layer effectively elastic on these timescales. We compute
surface displacements at 60 randomly chosen locations within a 400 km
square centered about the fault (Figure 4).  This is intended to
roughly correspond with the density of GPS station at a well
instrumented plate boundary.  We add temporally correlated noise to
the computed displacements through time consistent with what one would
expect from GPS observations.  The standard deviation of northing and
easting displacements is 1.0 mm, and the standard deviation of the
vertical displacements is 2.5 mm.  We add temporal covariance with an
exponential noise model that has a characteristic timescale of 0.25
years, which is intended to simulate seasonal processes that are
typically present in GPS timeseries.

\subsection{Green's functions}

We invert the synthetic surface deformation for fault slip on a 4 km
by 4 km discretization of the fault segment and we estimate a constant
viscosity in 10 km thick horizontal layers from the surface down to 70
km depth. We compute the elastic Green's functions, $F_i(\vec{x})$,
and initial viscoelastic Green's functions, $G_{ij}(\vec{x})$,
numerically using Pylith.  The elastic Green’s functions are the
initial surface displacements resulting from 1.0 m of imposed slip on
fault patch $i$.  For each fault patch, we use basis slip directions
with rake $45^\circ$ updip and $45^\circ$ downdip of pure
right-lateral slip.  These slip basis directions restrict all inferred
slip to be within $45^\circ$ of right-lateral. We find the initial
viscoelastic Green's functions, $G_{ij}(\vec{x})$, by computing the
initial rate of surface deformation due to 1.0 m of slip on fault
patch $i$ in a model that is elastic everywhere except in region $j$,
which is assigned a viscosity of $10^{18}$ Pa s.

We define the basis slip functions, $A_k(t)$, as a heaviside function
centered at $t=0.0$ and three ramp functions which increase from 0.0
to 1.0 m of slip over the time intervals $0.0\leq t < 0.5$ years,
$0.5\leq t < 1.0$ years, and $1.0\leq t < 10.0$ years.  Although our
synthetic model does not have any fault slip during the last time
interval, we include it to test if postseismic deformation over that
interval, which is resulting purely from viscoelastic creep in the
synthetic model, can be describe with continued fault slip.

\subsection{Recovered model}

Our best fitting model of slip on the fault is shown in Figure 2.  The
spatial distribution, direction, and magnitude of our inferred
coseismic slip is a good match to the synthetic coseismic slip.  This
is not surprising given that the magnitude of coseismic displacments
is far larger than the magnitude of the added noise. 

The surface displacements over the intervals $0.0<t<0.5$ years and
$0.5<t<1.0$ years are an order of magnitude smaller than the coseismic
displacements and so the postseismic signal is more obscured by the added
noise.  Consequently, we are not able to accurately recover the
spatial distribution of afterslip on the fault over these time
intervals.  However, the seismic moment of inferred afterslip is
consistent with the seismic moment in the synthetic model meaning that
the total amount of afterlip is well recovered but is largely smoothed
out over the fault plane by the regularization.  Our recovered model
is therefore accurately attributing deformation during this time
interval to afterslip rather than viscous deformation. We note that
lowering the penalty parameter for afterlip would result in a spatial
distribution of afterslip that is more consistent with the afterslip
in the synthetic model and it is possible that our recovered afterslip
would be better recovered using a method other than 10-fold cross
validation to find our penalty parameters.

The inferred slip over the last time interval, 1.0 to 10.0 years
following the earthquake, is also consistent with the synthetic model.
The seismic moment of slip over this interval is $5*10^{17}$ N m,
which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the moment for the
coseismic slip.  This means that the inferred slip is accounting for,
at most, a few mm's of displacement from $t=1.0$ to $t=10.0$ years.
This is on order of the data uncertainty and so the inferred slip is
negligably small.

The inferred viscosities in each of the eight layers are shown in
figure 3a.  The recovered viscosities correspond well with the
synthetic model except perhaps for the top layer from 0 to 10 km
depth.  We used bootstrapping to estimate the uncertainties of the
recovered viscosities and we found that the strongest layers near the
surface, despite being proximal to the earthquake source, have the
highest uncertanties.  However, viscosities greater than $~10^{20}$ Pa s are
effectively elastic on the timescales of this synthetic test and so a
wide range of high viscosities for the upper layers would just as
adequately be able to describe the synthetic surface displacements.
When looking at inferred values of fluidity (figure 3b), we see that
the uncertainties are lowest at the surface and increase with depth,
as is perhaps more intuitive.

%We note that our inferred viscosities are strongly influenced by the
%regularization.  Indeed, many far less smooth viscosity structures
%would be able to fit the synthetic data just as well as what is shown
%in figure 3.  Additionally, based on figure 6, larger regularization
%parameters could have been used at only a slight cost to the models
%predictive power.  That is to say, an even smoother viscosity
%structure than that shown would also be able to adequately describe the
%synthetic data.

\subsection{solution validation}
The fact that our recovered fault slip and lithospheric viscosity are
in good agreement with the synthetic model suggests that the
approximation given by eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is
accurate over the ten years of synthetic data.  We quantify the
accuracy of eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) by running a forward
model with Pylith where the imposed fault slip and lithospheric
viscosity are those found in our recovered model.  We then compare the
displacements from the numerically computed forward model with the
displacements predicted by eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}).  We
refer to the numerically computed displacements as
$\mitbf{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$ and the displacments predicted by our
approximation as $\mitbf{u}(t)$.  We define the approximation residuals
as $\mitbf{u}(t) - \mitbf{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$.

At $t=10.0$ years the approximation residuals are on order of a couple
mm's in length for each location and are small compared to the cm's of
deformation resulting from viscoelastic relaxation (figure 7),
indicating that eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is indeed a fair
approximation.  At $t=20$ years the approximation residuals are about
one cm in magnitude for near field sites, while the residuals are
still on order of a few mm's for the far field sites.  The faster
divergence for the near field sites is consistent with the comparison
we made between the approximate and true displacements for a
two-dimensional, two layered earthquake model in section 3.1.1.

The accuracy of eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is also
demonstrated in figure 5, which shows $\mitbf{u}(t)$ and
$\mitbf{u}(t)_{\mathrm{true}}$ at a sample site near the fault.  The
numerical solution asymptotically approaches the rate of deformation
predicted by eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) as time goes to
zero, demonstrating that eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity})
accurately descibes the initial viscoelastic response.  Additionally,
the magnitude of the difference between $\mitbf{u}(t)$ and
$\mitbf{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$ is smaller than the uncertainty on our synthetic
data throughout the time series, indicating that our approximation is
appropriate for this synthetic test.

%Figure 7 also shows the root mean square error as
%a function of time which we define as
%\begin{equation}
%  \mathrm{RMSE}(t) = \frac{\left|\left|\mitbf{u}(t) -
%    \mitbf{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)\right|\right|_2}{\sqrt{\mathrm{R}}},
%\end{equation}
%where R is the number of elements in $\mitbf{u}(t)$ and
%$\mitbf{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$.  The root mean square error describes
%the average amount that the approximate displacements deviate from
%the true displacements for a given time.  The RMSE increases
%quadratically from 0 at $t=0$ to a few millimeters at $t=20$. 

\section{Discussion}

A fundemental assumption in our method for estimating slip and
viscosity from postseismic deformation is that the timescale of
relaxation in the lithosphere is greater than or about equal to the
timescales over which postseismic deformation is observed.  This
assumption allows us to approximate the surface expression of viscous
creep as a linear system with respect to lithospheric fluidity, which
greatly facilitates and expedites the inverse problem.  However, the
lithosphere's relaxation time is generally not well known, and in
practice, we do not know how the relaxation time in the lithosphere
compares to the timescale of postseismic deformation.  There is then
an added complication of deciding how much of a postseismic timeseries
to use in the inverse problem.  In our synthetic example, we
conveniently picked the length of our timeseries to correspond with
the weakest relaxation time in the lithosphere; however, the length of
the timeseries could have also been determined iterative.  For
example, if the approximation given by
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is incapable of adequately
describing the observed postseismic deformation, then it is possible
that the length of the timeseries used in the inversion exceeds the
time interval over which eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is
appropriate.  One can reduce the length of the postseismic timeseries
used in the inversion until an adequate fit is found. The unused
portion of the time series could further constrain estimates of fault
slip and lithospheric viscosity by including it in a gradient based
nonlinear inverse method where the forward problem is computed
numerically rather that with eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}). In
such case, the initial guess for the model parameters should be the
estimate of slip and viscosity made using the truncated time series.

Our synthetic data is characterized by transient near field surface
deformation followed by a steady rate of more diffuse surface
deformation (figures 4 and 5).  This is qualitatively similar to
postseismic deformation following other large ($\geq$ Mw7) earthquakes
\citep[e.g.][]{E2009}.  Some researchers have proposed using
lithospheric rheologies other than Maxwell viscoelasticity to explain
this behavior \citep[e.g.][]{HH2005,P2005,P2003,F2006b}. We suggest
alternatively that fault creep and a relatively high viscosity Maxwell
viscoelastic lithosphere could also describe postseismic transient
deformation.  

Although, our inverse method assumes that the lithosphere is Maxwell
viscoelastic on the timescales of postseismic deformationl, we do not
preclude the possibility of a stress-nonlinear rheology \citep[e.g.][]{HK2003}.
the approximation given by eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation})
assumes that stresses in the lithosphere are not significantly
different from the stresses induced from fault slip.  Under the
assumption of constant stress, a material with a nonlinear rheology
will behave as a Maxwell viscoelastic material and it will have an
effective Maxwell viscosity.  This means that viscosities inferred
using the above inverse method can be instead interpretted as the
effective Maxwell viscosities for the current state of stress in the
lithosphere.

\section{Conclusion}

\appendix
\section{Inverse Laplace transorm through series expansion}

let $f(t)$ be analytic at $t=0$ and let there
  be a real valued $M$, and $C$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{constraints}
  \left|f^{(n)}(t)\right| < Ce^{Mt}\quad \forall t\geq 0\text{ and }\forall n\in\{0,1,2,\dots\},
\end{equation}
where $f^{(n)}(t)$ denotes the $n^{th}$ derivative of $f(t)$.  We
define the Laplace transform of $f(t)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}[f(t)] := \hat{f}(s) := \int_{0}^\infty f(t)e^{-st}dt
\end{equation}
and we restrict our attention to $s\in\mathbb{R}$.  The constraints on
$f^{(n)}(t)$ from eq. (\ref{constraints}) ensure that
\begin{equation}\label{Property2}
  \lim_{s \to \infty}\mathcal{L}[f^{(n)}(t)] = 0.
\end{equation}
It can be shown using integration by parts that
\begin{equation}\label{Property1}
  \mathcal{L}[f^{(n)}(t)] = s^n\hat{f}(s) - \sum_{m=1}^ns^{m-1}f^{(n-m)}(0)
  \quad \forall s>M.
\end{equation}
Substituting eq. (\ref{Property1}) into eq. (\ref{Property2}) and then
rearranging the terms gives us a recursive formula for $f^{(n)}(0)$ in
terms of $\hat{f}(s)$:
\begin{equation}\label{NthDeriv}
  f^{(n)}(0) = 
  \begin{cases}
    \lim_{s \to \infty} s\hat{f}(s)& \text{if } n=0\\
    \lim_{s \to \infty} s^{n + 1}\hat{f}(s) - 
                     \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} s^{m+1}f^{(n-m-1)}(0)& \text{if } n > 0.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Since we request $f(t)$ to be analytic at $t=0$, we can construct a
Taylor series expansion of $f(t)$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{TaylorSeries}
  f(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}t^n \quad \forall {t\in D},
\end{equation}
where $D$ is some neighborhood of $t=0$. We find the inverse Laplace
transform of $\hat{f}(s)$ for $t\in D$ by combining
eq. (\ref{TaylorSeries}) with eq. (\ref{NthDeriv}) so that $f(t)$ is
expressed in terms of $\hat{f}(s)$.

\section{Postseismic approximation for an arbitrary depth dependent viscosity}
We seek to find an approximation for early postseismic deformation in
a two-dimensional halfspace with an arbitrary depth-dependent
viscosity.  From eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}) we know that
there exists some depth-dependent kernel, $K(x,z)$, such that the initial rate of surface
deformation following a unit of slip is 
\begin{equation}\label{step0}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x,t)\big|_{t=0} = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\eta(z)}K(x,z) dz,
\end{equation}
where $z$ is positive with depth and zero at the surface.  In order to
find $K(x,z)$, we use eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscous}) to obtain the initial
rate of surface deformation for a halfspace consisting of an elastic layer extending to
depth $H$ and a viscoelastic substrate with viscosity $\eta$:
\begin{align}\label{step1}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u_1(x,t)\big|_{t=0} 
    &= \frac{\mu}{2\pi\eta}\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2H + D}{x}\right) - 
                                 \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2H - D}{x}\right)\right)\\
    &= \int_H^\infty \frac{1}{\eta}K(x,z) dz.  
\end{align}
We find $K(x,z)$ which satisfies the above equation to be
\begin{equation}\label{kernel}
  K(x,z) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(D + 2z\right)^2} -
           \frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(2z - D\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
We use \ref{kernel} in \ref{step0} to obtain the initial viscoelastic
response for a lithosphere with an arbitary depth-dependent viscosity
below $D$ and then add the initial elastic displacements to obtain an
approximation for early postseismic deformation:
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) \approx \frac{b(t)}{\pi}\tan^{-1}(\frac{D}{x}) + 
               \int_o^t\int_D^\infty \frac{\mu b(\theta)}{2\pi\eta(z)}
                                    \left(\frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(D + 2z\right)^2} - 
                                    \frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(2z - D\right)^2}\right)
                                    dz d\theta.
\end{equation}
