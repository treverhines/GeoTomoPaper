\section{Introduction}
Geodetic observations of surface deformation in the months to years
following an earthquake are often attributed to afterslip
\citep[e.g.][]{M1991}, viscoelastic relaxation in the lithosphere
\citep[e.g.][]{NM1974}, and/or poroelastic-relaxation
\citep[e.g.][]{P1998,J2003}.  If postseismic deformation can be
entirely described by afterslip, then one could easily constrain the
spatial distribution of fault slip with a linear least squares
inversion \citep[e.g.][]{F2007,B2002,H1987}, which could then provide
insight into the frictional properties of faults
\citep[e.g.][]{B2009}.  However, postseismic deformation following
large (Mw$\geq$7) earthquakes is often attributed to viscoelastic
relaxation in the lithosphere \citep[e.g.][]{P2003,P2005,HH2003} or a
combination of both afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation
\citep[e.g.][]{H2008,R2015}.  In such cases, postseismic deformation
can be used to constrain the lithosphere's viscous properties;
however, this is a more difficult task than constraining a slip
distribution.  Not only are there potentially competing deformation
mechanism which must be discerned, finding the viscosity of
the lithopshere from postseimsic deformation is a computationally
expensive nonlinear inverse problem.  Typically, this is approached
with a forward modeling grid search method.  These forward modeling
techniques require the number of unknown parameters being estimated to
be small, meaning that significant and potentially inappropriate
modeling assumptions must be made \citep{H2013,RG2008}.

In this paper we propose a relatively fast method to kinematically
invert coseismic and postseismic deformation to simultaneously
estimate a time dependent distribution of fault slip and an
arbitrarily discretized viscosity structure of the lithosphere.  Our
method is based on an approximation which linearizes the rate of early
postseismic deformation with respect to the viscosity of the
lithosphere.  We demonstrate the efficacy and limitations of our
method through a synthetic test.

\section{Linearizing early postseismic deformation} 
On the timescales of postseismic deformation, the lithosphere can be
approximated as a Maxwell viscoelastic material where, in the one
dimensional form, stress and strain are related by
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial\bold{\varepsilon}}{\partial t}=\frac{\bold{\sigma}}{\eta} + 
                              \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial\bold{\sigma}}{\partial t}.
\end{equation}
$\eta$ and $\mu$ are viscosity and shear modulus respectively.  This
constitutive relationship implies that a sudden strain in the
lithosphere from an earthquake will instantaneously propagate stresses
through the lithosphere elastically (assuming the lithosphere is
undergoing quasi-static deformation).  Creep will also initiate
immediately after the earthquake, where the viscous strain rate in
each parcel of the lithosphere will be proportional to the reciprocal
of viscostity in that parcel and independent of the viscosity
elsewhere.  Each parcel will continue to creep at approximately that
rate for as long as the initial elastic stresses from the earthquake
are large compared to the stresses transferred through viscous
relaxation.  In this early postseismic period, creep in each parcel
will express itself as surface deformation with an amplitude also
proportional to the repicrocal of that parcels viscosity.  The surface
expression of viscous creep throughout the lithosphere is therefor a
linear sum of the surface expression of each parcel.  This linearity
of early postseismic surface deformation with respect to lithospheric
viscosity is demonstrated below using simple anti-plane strain
earthquake models where the lithosphere is approximated as a layered
halfspace.  We use this linearity to construct a simple approximation
for early postseismic deformation, which greatly facilitates the
inverse problem aimed at estimating the amount of slip on a fault and
lithospheric viscosity.

The easiest way to demonstrate how postseismic deformation can be
linearized with respect to lithospheric viscosity is with a simple two
dimensional earthquake model which consists of a long, vertical,
surface rupturing, strike-slip fault oriented in the anti-plane
direction and embedded in a viscoelastic horizontal layer overlying a
viscoelastic halfspace.  We make use of the correspondence principle
of viscoelasticity \citep{F1975}, which states that the Laplace
transform of deformation in a viscoelastic body has the same form as
the Laplace transform of deformation in a elastic body with the same
geometry and subjected to the same boundary conditions. The solution
for displacement following an earthquake in a viscoelastic lithosphere
can then be easily found provided that the solution for displacement
in an elastic lithosphere with the same geometry is known.  One only
needs to replace the shear modulus in the Laplace transform of the
elastic solution with the effective viscoelastic shear modulus and
then compute the inverse Laplace transform
\citep[e.g.][]{HH2005,NM1974,SP1978}.

The appropriate elastic solution to start from
is given by \citet{R1971}.  Surface displacements, $u_{e}(x,t)$,
resulting from slip on a fault in a two layered elastic half-space
are
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerElastic}
  u_{e}(x,t) = b(t)\left(\frac{1}{2} W(0) + 
    \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Gamma^nW(n)\right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  W(n) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\tan^{-1}(\frac{2nH + D}{x}) 
    - \tan^{-1}(\frac{2nH - D}{x})\right)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\mu_1 + \mu_2}.
\end{equation}
In the above equation $b(t)$ describes cummulative slip on the fault
over time and describes both coseismic slip and afterslip. $D$ is the
locking depth of the fault, $H$ is the thickness of the upper layer,
and $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the shear modulii in the upper layer and
lower half-space respectively.

We then find the Laplace transform of surface displacements in the
viscoelastic layered half-space by taking the Laplace transform of eq
(\ref{TwoLayerElastic}), 
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerElasticLaplace}
 \hat{u}_e(x,s) = \hat{b}(s)\left(\frac{1}{2} W(0) +\sum_{n=1}^\infty\Gamma^nW(n)\right),
\end{equation}
and replacing $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ with the
equivalent shear modulii for Maxwell materials in the Laplace domain,
$\hat{\mu}_1$ and $\hat{\mu}_2$.  The Laplace transform of surface
displacements for the viscoelastic model is then
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerViscousLaplace}
 \hat{u}_v(x,s) = \hat{b}(s)\left(\frac{1}{2}W(0) +\sum_{n=1}^\infty\hat{\Gamma}^nW(n)\right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Gamma} = \frac{\hat{\mu_1} - \hat{\mu_2}}{\hat{\mu_1} + \hat{\mu_2}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mu_1} = \frac{s}{\frac{s}{\mu_1} + \frac{1}{\eta_1}} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,  
  \hat{\mu_2} = \frac{s}{\frac{s}{\mu_2} + \frac{1}{\eta_2}}.
\end{equation}

To find the surface displacements in the time domain one must find the
inverse Lapace transform of eq (\ref{TwoLayerViscousLaplace}), which
is typically done using the method of residues
\citep[e.g.][]{NM1974}. However, we are interested in characterizing
the behavior of early postseismic deformation and it better serves
us to instead perform the inverse Laplace transform with an extension
of the initial value theorem. This method is described in the
appendix.

For simplicity, we assume that the shear modulus for the viscoelastic
lithosphere is homogenous throughout the lithosphere (i.e. $\mu_1 =
\mu_2$).  We demonstrate in a supplementary ipython notebook that our
conclusions here still hold when $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$.  The surface
displacements in the time domain are then 
\begin{equation}
 u_v(x,t) = b(t)\frac{1}{2}W(0) + 
            b(t)\ast\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left[\sum_{n=1}^\infty\hat{\Gamma}^{n}W(n)\right]
\end{equation}
Evaluating the above inverse Laplace transform using the method
described in the appendix gives us a series expansion of the surface
deformation resulting from viscous creep.
\begin{align}\label{TwoLayerViscous}
  u_v(x,t) = &b(t)\frac{1}{2}W(0) +\nonumber\\
             &b(t)\ast\left(\frac{\mu}{2\eta_2}W(1) - \frac{\mu}{2\eta_1}W(1)\right) +\nonumber\\
             &b(t)\ast\left(\left(\frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_2^2} -
                  \frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_1\eta_2}\right) \left(W(1) - W(2)\right) +
                  \left(\frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_1\eta_2} - \frac{\mu^2t}{4\eta_1^2}\right)
                  \left(W(1) + W(2)\right)\right) + \nonumber\\ 
             &\dots
\end{align} 
The first term of the series in eq (\ref{TwoLayerViscous}) is the
surface displacement resulting from the elastic transfer of stresses
from slip on the fault.  The remaining terms are describing the
surface deformation resulting from viscous creep induced by those
stresses. Of these remaining terms, the first is the initial rate of
surface deformation resulting from viscous creep following a unit of
slip and it is convolved with the fault slip history.  As suggested,
this initial viscous response is a linear expression with
respect to the inverse viscosity of the two layers.

If the time since the rupture is sufficiently small compared to the
relaxation times of each layer, $\tau_i=\frac{\eta_i}{\mu}$, (i.e. the third and
following terms in eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscous}) are small), then we can
truncate the series and approximate early surface deformation as
\begin{equation}\label{TwoLayerViscousApprox}
 u_v(x,t) \approx b(t)\frac{1}{2}W(0) + 
          \int_0^t b(t)\left(\frac{\mu}{2\eta_2}W(1) - \frac{\mu}{2\eta_1}W(1)\right)dt.
\end{equation} 
This approximation consists of the elastic response to slip on a
dislocation added to the intantaneous viscous response to a unit of
slip convolved with the faults slip history.  The fact that the
instantaneous viscous response is linear with respect to the
lithospheric viscosity is a general feature for Maxwell-viscoelastic
media and we use a similar approximation when considering an
arbitrarily discretized lithosphere in section 3.1.  It is therefor
valuable to explore the quality of the above approximation for this
simple two layered case. Figure 1 shows the series solution from
eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscous}) truncated at a sufficiently large N as
well as the approximation given by eq. (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}).
We use shear modulus 32.0 GPa throughout the lithosphere and
viscosities $10^{20}$ and $10^{19} \mathrm{Pa}\cdot\mathrm{s}$ for the
top layer and lower half-space respectively.  We let b(t) describe 5
meters of instantaneous slip at $t=0$.  It should be noted that a
similar approximation was demonstrated by \citet{S2010} for an elastic
layer over a Maxwell viscoelastic half-space.  The approximate
solution coincides with the series expansion up until about 6 years
after the earthquake.  At that point, the approximation begins to
appreciably overestimate the series solution.  In our experience the
approximate given by (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) is accurate for
about as long as the relaxation time of the weakest layer, which is 10
years in this case.

The approximation given above evidently does not account for the
viscous coupling between the two layers since either layers
contribution to surface deformation is independent of the other layers
viscosity.  So one could also consider this approximation as being
appropriate for as long as the layers do not significantly transfer
stresses between eachother through viscous deformation.

It is worth noting that the instantaneous viscous response of the
uppermost layer and lower half-space differ only in sign and in
amplitude.  In the context of an inverse problem, this means that it
is impossible to use (\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) to estimate the
absolute viscosity of the two layers, rather it is only be possible to
estimate their relative viscosities.  This is not a difficult obstacle
to overcome because in application we can typically assume that the
upper layer has a sufficiently long Maxwell relaxation time such that
it is effectively elastic over the postseismic period.

We follow the same procedure from above to find the surface
deformation resulting from slip on a strike-slip fault in a three
layered viscoelastic halfspace.  To do so we start with the solution
for a three layer elastic halfspace provided by \citet{CJ1972}.  We
evaluate the solution for the viscoelastic problem in our
supplementary ipython notebook. Once again, we find that the
instantaneous viscous response is linear with respect to the inverse
viscosity in each of the three layers and we are able to approximate
early postseismic deformation resulting from slip described by $b(t)$
as
\begin{equation}\label{ThreeLayerViscousApprox}
u_v(x,t) \approx b(t)\frac{1}{2} W(0,0) + 
         \int_0^tb(\theta)\left(\frac{\mu}{2\eta_3}W(1,1)
                               +\frac{\mu}{2\eta_2}(W(0,1) - W(1,1))
                               -\frac{\mu}{2\eta_1}W(0,1)\right)d\theta
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  W(n,m) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left(\tan^{-1}(\frac{2nH_2 + 2mH_1 + D}{x}) - 
                              \tan^{-1}(\frac{2nH_2 + 2mH_1 - D}{x})\right)
\end{equation}
and $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$, and $\eta_3$ are the viscosities of the top,
middle, and bottom layers respectively, while $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the
thicknesses of the top and middle layer respectively.  We can see that
eq. (\ref{ThreeLayerViscousApprox}) recovers eq.
(\ref{TwoLayerViscousApprox}) when $\eta_3 = \eta_2$. 

At this point, we posit that a similar approximation can be made for
an arbitrarily layered lithosphere, at least for the two dimensional
case.  With this assumption, we can then use
eq. (\ref{ThreeLayerViscousApprox}) to find an instantaneous viscous
response kernel and then integrate that kernel over the depth of the
lithosphere to find the instantaneous viscous response for an
arbitrary depth dependent viscosity structure.  If the lithsophere is
elastic above the fault depth, $D$, and described by $\eta(z)$ below
$D$ then early postseismic deformation can be described as:
\begin{equation}\label{ContinuousViscousApprox}
u(x,t) \approx \frac{b(t)}{\pi}\tan^{-1}(\frac{D}{x}) + 
               \int_o^t\int_D^\infty \frac{\mu b(\theta)}{2\pi\eta(\zeta)}
                                    \left(\frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(D + 2\zeta\right)^2} - 
                                    \frac{2x}{x^2 + \left(2\zeta - D\right)^2}\right)
                                    d\zeta d\theta.
\end{equation}
Although the above equation is capable of describing an arbitrary
viscosity structure, it falls short of being useful as the forward
solution in an inverse problem aimed at estimating lithospheric
viscosity.  This is because the above equation makes the unphysical
assumption that the fault is infinitely long.  This would introduce
first order errors, which would likely wash out the second order effect
of viscosity. Instead, we find eq. (\ref{ContinuousViscousApprox})
useful for making estimates of the depth sensitivity of
postseismic deformation.  

\subsection{Arbitrary Composite Maxwell Model}
Motivated by our above results, we make the assertion that the initial
rate of surface deformation resulting from an instantaneous
dislocation in any two or three dimensional Maxwell viscoelastic
medium, which has been arbitrarily discretized into N regions, will
have the form
\begin{equation}\label{PostseismicInitialVelocity}
  \frac{\delta}{\delta t}u(x,t)\big|_{t=0} = \sum_j^N\frac{1}{\eta_j}G_j(x).
\end{equation}
$G_j(x)$ is the initial rate of surface deformation resulting from
creep when the reciprocal of the viscosity in region $j$ is one and
zero everywhere else (i.e. elastic).  In this sense, $G_j(x)$ can be
thought of as a Green's function for the initial rate of surface
deformation resulting for viscous creep and we will refer to $G_j(x)$
as the instantaneous viscous Green's function.  We verify eq
\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity} numerically in section 5.5 and save a
more rigorous justification for a later paper.

We can then approximate surface deformation as
\begin{equation}
  u(x,t) \approx b(t)F(x) + \sum_j^N\int_0^t \frac{b(\theta)}{\eta_j}G_j(x) d\theta
\end{equation}
where $F(x)$ is the elastic Green's function, which describes the
elastic deformation resulting from a dislocation with a unit of slip.

We further generalize this approximation of surface deformation to
allow for an arbitrary spatial distribution of slip by using linear
superposition.  If the elastic defomation in a viscoelastic
lithosphere can be described in terms of M elastic dislocation
sources, then early surface deformation resulting from both elastic
dislocations and viscous creep can be approximated as
\begin{equation}\label{Postseismic_Approximation}
u(x,t) \approx \sum_i^Mb_i(t)F_i(x) + 
               \sum_i^M\sum_j^N\int_0^t\frac{b_i(\theta)}{\eta_j}G_{ij}(x) d\theta.
\end{equation}
Note that the instantaneous viscous Green's function is dependent upon
both the region it represents as well as the dislocation source which
induces the viscous relaxation in that region, hence the two indices.
If the geometry of the fault and lithosphere are sufficiently simple
then $F_i(x)$ and $G_{ij}(x)$ can be determined analytically, as
demonstrated in the previous section.  For more complicated two or
three dimensional geometries, numerical methods are required to
compute $F_i(x)$ and $G_{ij}(x)$.

\section{Inversion method}
The approximation of postseismic deformation given by eq
(\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) can be cast as an inverse problem
aimed at finding the distribution of slip on a fault and an
arbitrarily complicated lithosphere viscosity structure from
postseismic deformation.
  
We assume that the slip history in any one direction on each
fault patch, $b_i(t)$, can be expressed as P linear terms such that
\begin{equation}
  b_i(t) = \sum_k^P \alpha_{ik}A_k(t) .
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^t b_i(\theta)d\theta = \sum_k^P\alpha_{ik}B_k(t) .
\end{equation}
In this paper, $A_k(t)$ consists of either step functions, which
describe coseismic slip on a fault patch, and ramp functions, which
describe afterslip on a fault patch over a time interval.  The
approximation given by eq (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) now
becomes
\begin{equation}\label{Postseismic_Approximation2}
u(x,t) \approx \sum_i^M\sum_k^P\alpha_{ik}F_i(x)A_k(t) + 
               \sum_i^M\sum_j^N\sum_k^P\frac{\alpha_{ik}}{\eta_j}G_{ij}(x)B_k(t).
\end{equation}
If we assume that the fault geometry and the elastic properties of the
lithosphere are well known then we can numerically compute
$F_i(x)$. Likewise, we assume some sufficiently fine discretization of
the viscous regions in the lithosphere. This allows us to compute
$G_{ij}(x)$ numerically.  We are left with the unknown slip
parameters, $\alpha_{ik}$, and unknown viscosities in each region of
the lithosphere, $\eta_j$.

We estimate these unknown parameters from observations of surface
deformation as an inverse problem. Let $\bold{u_{obs}}$ be a vector of
observed coseismic and postseismic surface displacements at various
locations and points in time.  Let $\bold{m}$ be a vector of all the
unknown parameters in $\alpha_{ik}$ and $\eta_j$ with length $Q=M+N+P$
and let $\bold{u(m)}$ be a vector of postseismic surface displacements
predicted by eq (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation2}). We seek to solve
\begin{equation}\label{Inverse_Problem}
  \mathrm{min}
  \big|\big|\bold{f(m)}\big|\big|_2^2
\end{equation}
subject to the constraint that
\begin{equation}
  \bold{m}\geq0,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  \bold{f(m)} = 
    \begin{vmatrix}
      \bold{W}\left(\bold{u(m)}-\bold{u}_{\mathrm{obs}}\right)\\
      \bold{Lm}\\
    \end{vmatrix} .
\end{equation}  
In the above equation, $\bold{W}$ is the inverse of the data
covariance matrix. Because this inverse problem inevitably has
nonunique solutions for $\bold{m}$, we put additional constraints on
the model parameters with the matrix $\bold{L}$.  In our following
synthetic tests we further constrain the solution by minimizing the
Laplacian of the spatial distribution of fault slip and lithospheric
viscosity.  We do so by letting $\bold{L}$ be the umbrella operator
\citep{D1999} such that
\begin{equation}
  \sum_j^{Q}L_{ij}m_j = \frac{\lambda_i}{|\mathcal{N}(i)|}\sum_{k\in \mathcal{N}(i)} m_k - m_i
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{N}(i)$ denotes the set of indices for model parameters
describing slip (viscosity) which is adjacent to the slip (viscosity)
described by $m_i$. $\lambda_i$ is a penalty parameter which controls
how much we enforce the smoothness constraint. We allow $\lambda_i$ to
vary based on the model parameters it is smoothing because a constant
penalty parameter would cause the fault slip parameters,
$\alpha_{ik}$, to be regularized just as much as the viscosity
parameters, $\eta_j$.  This may not be desirable because viscosity is
not as well constrained by postseismic deformation and therefor would
require a larger penalty parameter than for the fault slip
parameters. Likewise, the parameters in $\alpha_{ik}$ which describe
coseismic slip are likely to be better constained than the parameters
in $\alpha_{ik}$ describing afterslip.  We therefor use 10-fold cross
validation to find an optimal penalty parameters for the coseismic
slip parameters, afterslip parameters, and viscosity parameters.

We impose a nonnegativity constraint on the slip parameters because it
ensures that inferred slip is in one predominant direction.
Specifically, it constrains the rake of inferred slip on each fault
patch to be between the rake of our chosen basis slip
directions. Additionally, the nonnegativity constraint on $\bold{m}$
prevents unphysical viscosity inferences.

We find $\bold{m}$ that satisfies the above conditions with the
Gauss-Newton method \citep{A2013}.  The best fit model parameters are
found by making an initial guess for the solution and then iteratively
solving
\begin{equation}\label{Gauss-Newton}
\bold{J}(\bold{m}^{k})\bold{m}^{k+1} = -\bold{f}(\bold{m}^k) + \bold{J}(\bold{m}^{k})\bold{m}^{k}
\end{equation}
for $\bold{m}^{k+1}$.  $\bold{J}(\bold{m}^k)$ is the Jacobian of
$\bold{f(m)}$ with respect to $\bold{m}$ evaluated at $\bold{m^k}$. We
impose the nonnegativity constraint on $\bold{m}$ by solving eq
(\ref{Gauss-Newton}) with a nonnegative least squares algoritm
\cite{LH1974}.

We find that it is occasionally necessary to constrain the step size
for each iteration of eq (\ref{Gauss-Newton}) in order to ensure
convergence.  We do so in a manner akin to the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm \citep{A2013}.  So we instead solve
\begin{equation}\label{Levenberg-Marquardt}
  \bold{J^*}(\bold{m}^k)\bold{m}^{k+1} = -\bold{f^*}(\bold{m}^k) + \bold{J^*}(\bold{m}^k)\bold{m}^k
\end{equation}
for $m^{k+1}$, where
\begin{equation}
  \bold{J^*}(\bold{m}) = 
      \begin{vmatrix}
      \bold{J}(\bold{m})\\
      \kappa\bold{I}
      \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \bold{f^*}(\bold{m}) = 
      \begin{vmatrix}
      \bold{f}(\bold{m})\\
      \bold{0}
      \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ controls the step size for each iteration and varies
depending on whether the algorithm is converging.  

In a nonlinear least squares algorithm, computing the Jacobian
typically is the largest computational burden; however in this case,
evaluating the Jacobian of eq (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation2})
requires only a few computationally inexpensive matrix operation.
Consequently, our nonlinear least squares algorithm converges to a
solution for $\bold{m}$ in a matter of seconds on a desktop computer.  The
main computational burden is in computing $F_i(x)$ and $G_{ij}(x)$
which is done with finite element software and only needs to be done
once for a given fault and lithosphere geometry.

Throughout this paper, our initial guess for the model parameters is
that there is no slip on any fault patch, and the lithosphere is
entirely elastic ($\eta^{-1} = 0$).  In our experience, the choice of
initial conditions has an insignificant effect on the best fit
solution.

\section{Synthetic test}
\subsection{Synthetic postseismic deformation}

We demonstrate that our inverse method is capable of recovering fault
slip and lithospheric viscosity from postseismic deformation with a
synthetic test.  We use the finite element software, Pylith
\citep{A2007}, to compute the surface deformation resulting from a
specified amount of slip on a fault in a lithosphere with a specified
viscosity.  We invert this synthetic surface deformation using the
method described above to see if we are able to recover the imposed
model parameters.  The synthetic test also serves to demonstrate that
eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}) and
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) are indeed valid for three
dimensional earthquake models.

Our synthetic model consists of a 50 km long by 20 km wide strike-slip
fault striking north and dipping $60^{\circ}$ to the east (figure
4). At $t=0.0$ we impose $6.54*10^{19}$ N m of
surface rupturing right-lateral coseismic slip with a distribution
shown in figure 2.  After the coseismic slip we impose a constant rate
of afterslip from $t=0.0$ to $t=0.5$ years.  The cumulative seismic
moment over this interval is about \%16 that of the coseismic slip.
The spatial distribution of afterslip is shown in figure 2.  During
the interval $t=0.5$ to $t=1.0$ years the rate of afterslip is
decreased by a factor of 2.  From $t=1.0$ year onward we do not impose any
slip.

The lithosphere in our synthetic model is Maxwell viscoelastic with
homogenous Lam\'e parameters $\lambda = 32.0$ GPa and $\mu = 32.0$
GPa.  The viscosity in the lithosphere decays from $10^{21}$ Pa s
($\tau=1,000$ years) at the surface to $10^{19}$ Pa s ($\tau=10$
years) at 75 km depth (figure 3).  We compute displacements at 0.1
year intervals up until $t=10$ years, which makes our chosen upper bound on
viscosity effectively elastic on these timescales.

We compute surface displacements at 60 randomly chosen locations
within a 400 km square centered about the fault (figure 4).  This is
intended to roughly correspond with the density of GPS station at a
well instrumented plate boundary.

Additionally, we add noise to our displacements which is consistent
with what one would expect from GPS observations.  The noise is
temporally correlated with a characteristic timescale of 0.25 years.
The temporal covariance is intended to simulate seasonal processes
which are typically present in GPS timeseries.  The standard deviation
of northing and easting displacements is 1.0 mm, and the standard
deviation of the vertical displacements is 2.5 mm.

\subsection{Green's functions}

We invert the synthetic surface deformation for fault slip on a 4 km
by 4 km discretization of the synthetic fault segment and we estimate
viscosity in 10 km thick horizontal layers from the surface down to 70
km depth.

We compute the elastic Green's functions, $F_i(x)$, and instantaneous
viscous Green's functions, $G_{ij}(x)$, numerically using Pylith.  The
elastic Green’s functions are the initial displacements resulting from
1.0 m of imposed slip on fault patch $i$.  For each fault patch we
compute the elastic Green's functions for slip with rake $45^\circ$
updip and $45^\circ$ downdip of pure right-lateral slip.  This
restricts all inferred slip to be withing $45^\circ$ of
right-lateral. We compute the instantaneous viscous Green's functions
by setting the lithosphere to be elastic everywhere except in region
$j$, which is assigned a viscosity of $10^{18}$ Pa s.  We then impose
1.0 m of slip on fault patch $i$ and use the computed initial
rates of surface deformation as $G_{ij}(x)$.

We define the basis slip functions, $A_k(t)$, as a heaviside function
centered at $t=0.0$ and three ramp functions which increase from 0.0 to
1.0 m of slip over the time intervals $0.0\leq t < 0.5$ years,
$0.5\leq t < 1.0$ years, and $1.0\leq t < 10.0$ years.  Although our
synthetic model does not have any fault slip during the last time
interval, we include it to test if postseismic deformation over that
interval, which is resulting purely from viscous creep, can be
describe with continued fault slip.

\subsection{Recovered model}

Our best fitting model of slip on the fault is shown in figure 2.  The
spatial distribution, direction, and magnitude of our inferred
coseismic slip is a good match to the synthetic coseismic slip.  This
is not surprising given that the magnitude of coseismic displacments
is far larger than the magnitude of the added noise. 

The surface displacements over the intervals $0.0<t<0.5$ years and
$0.5<t<1.0$ years are an order of magnitude smaller than the coseismic
displacements and the postseismic signal is more obscured by the added
noise.  Consequently, we are not able to accurately recover the
spatial distribution of afterslip on the fault over these time
intervals.  However, the seismic moment of inferred afterslip is
consistent with the seismic moment in the synthetic model meaning that
the total amount of afterlip is well recovered but is largely smoothed
out over the fault plane by the regularization.  Our recovered model
is therefor accurately attributing deformation during this time
interval to afterslip rather than viscous deformation. We note that
lowering the penalty parameter for afterlip would result in a spatial
distribution of afterslip that is more consistent with the afterslip
in the synthetic model and it is possible that our recovered afterslip
would be better recovered using a method other than 10-fold cross
validation to find our penalty parameters.

The inferred slip over the last time interval, 1.0 to 10.0 years
following the earthquake, is also consistent with the synthetic model.
The seismic moment of slip over this interval is $5*10^{17}$ N m,
which is two orders of magnitude smaller than for the coseismic slip.
This means that the inferred slip is accounting for, at most, a few mm's
of displacement from $t=1.0$ to $t=10.0$ years.  This is on order of the
data uncertainty and so the inferred slip is negligably small.  

The inferred viscosities in each of the eight layers are shown in
figure 3a.  The recovered viscosities correspond well with the
synthetic model except perhaps for the top layer from 0 to 10 km
depth.  We used bootstrapping to estimate the uncertainties of the
recovered viscosities and we found that the strongest layers near the
surface, despite being proximal to the earthquake source, have the
highest uncertanties.  However, viscosities greater than $~10^{20}$ Pa s are
effectively elastic on the timescales of this synthetic test and so a
wide range of high viscosities for the upper layers would just as
adequately be able to describe the synthetic surface displacements.
When looking at inferred values of fluidity (figure 3b), we see that
the uncertainties are lowest at the surface and increase with depth,
as is perhaps more intuitive.

We note that our inferred viscosities are strongly influenced by the
regularization.  Indeed, many far less smooth viscosity structures
would be able to fit the synthetic data just as well as what is shown
in figure 3.  Additionally, based on figure 6, larger regularization
parameters could have been used at only a slight cost to the models
predictive power.  That is to say, an even smoother viscosity
structure than that shown would also be able to adequately describe the
synthetic data.

\subsection{solution validation}
The fact that our recovered fault slip and lithospheric viscosity are
in good agreement with the synthetic model suggests that the
approximation given by eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is
accurate over the ten years of synthetic data.  We will quantify the
accuracy of eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}), and thereby eq
(\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}), by running a forward model where
the imposed fault slip and lithospheric viscosity are those found in
our recovered model.  We then compare the displacements from the
numerically computed forward model with the displacements predicted by
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}).  We will refer to the
numerically computed displacements at time $t$ as
$\bold{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$ and the displacments at time $t$
predicted by our approximation as $\bold{u}(t)$.  We define the
approximation residuals as $\bold{u}(t) - \bold{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$.

Figure 7 shows a map view of the approximation residuals at $t=10.0$
and $t=20.0$.  The approximation residuals at $t=10.0$ years are small
(mm's) compared to the magnitude of displacements at this time
(cm's)(figure 4), indicating that
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is indeed a fair approximation
over these timescales.  The validity of
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is more clearly demonstrated in
figure 5, which shows $\bold{u}(t)$ (black line) and
$\bold{u}(t)_{\mathrm{true}}$ (red line) at the site closest to the
fault.  The numerical solution asymptotically approaches the steady
rate of postseismic deformation predicted by
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) as the time goes to zero, as
implied by eq. (\ref{PostseismicInitialVelocity}).  The approximation
begins to notably diverge from the numerical solution about 10 years
after the earthquake.

The residuals shown in Figure 7 are in the same direction
as the viscous deformation (figure 4c) indicating that our
approximation consistently overestimates the amount of surface
deformation resulting from viscous relaxation.  The residuals are
larger at the near field sites than at the far field sites with
relative magnitude about equal to what is seen in figure 4c.  10 years
after the earthquake, the error is consistently on order of the
imposed data uncertainty.  20 years after the earthquake, errors
become appreciably large for the near field sites.

Figure 7 also shows the root mean square error as
a function of time, $\mathrm{RMSE}(t)$, which we define as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{RMSE}(t) = \frac{\left|\left|\bold{u}(t) -
    \bold{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)\right|\right|_2}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Q}}}
\end{equation}
where Q is the number of elements in $\bold{u}(t)$ and
$\bold{u}_{\mathrm{true}}(t)$.  The root mean square error describes
how much we would expect the approximate displacements to deviate from
the true displacements for a given time.  Generally speaking, our
approximation can be considered reasonably accurate when the root mean square error
is lower than the observation uncertainty.  The RMSE increases
quadratically from 0 at $t=0$ to a few millimeters at $t=20$.  When
considering that noise for geodetic observations is also on order of a
few millimeters, this approximation appears to be sufficiently
accurate for at least up until $t=10$ years.


\section{Discussion}

Our method for estimating slip and viscosity from postseismic
deformation makes the assumption that the timescale of relaxation in
the lithosphere is greater than or about equal to the timescales over
which postseismic deformation is observed.  Since the lithosphere's
relaxation time is generally not well known, there is the added
complication of deciding how much of a postseismic timeseries to use
in the above described inverse method.  We conveniently picked the
length of our timeseries to correspond with the weakest relaxation
time in the lithosphere; however, the length of the timeseries could
have also been determined iteratively.  If the approximation given by
eq. (\ref{Postseismic_Approximation}) is incapable of adequately
describing obersvations, then it is likely that the timeseries used in
the inversion is too long.  One can reduce the length of the
postseismic timeseries used in the inversion until an adequate fit is
found.

Our synthetic data is characterized by transient near field surface
deformation followed by a steady rate of more diffuse surface
deformation.  This is qualitatively similar to postseismic
deformation following other large ($\geq$ Mw7) earthquakes
(\citep{P2003,P2005,R2007,R2015}).  Some have sought to explain this
pattern of surface deformation using a more complex lithospheric
rheology capable of transient deformation. We suggest
alternatively that fault creep and a relatively high viscosity
lithosphere would also be capable of describing the commonly observed
patterns of postseismic deformation.  In such case, our method
described here would allow us to easily constrain the amount of slip
and the lithospheric viscosity necessary to describe observed
postseismic deformation

Laboratory studies suggest that the lithospheres rheology is generally
nonlinear with respect to stress, contradicting our assumption that
the lithosphere is Maxwell viscoelastic.  However, the above described
approximation assumes that stresses in the lithosphere are not
significantly different from the stresses induced from fault slip.
Under the assumption of constant stress, a material with a nonlinear
rheology will behave as a Maxwell viscoelastic material and it will
have an effective Maxwell viscosity.  This means that viscosities
inferred using the above inverse method can be instead interpretted as
the effective Maxwell viscosities for the current state of stress in
the lithosphere.

Discuss how the solution found here can be used as a first step in a
nonlinear least squares algorithm where the forward problem requires
using a FEM rather than eq. \ref{Postseismic_Approximation}
\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Appendix}
let $f(t)$ and all of its derivatives be continuous and bounded such
that its Laplace transform exists (i.e. of exponential type).  We
define the Laplace transform of $f(t)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}[f(t)] := \hat{f}(s) := \int_{0}^\infty f(t)e^{-st}dt.
\end{equation}
It can be easily shown using integration by parts that the Laplace
transform of the $n^{th}$ derivative of $f(t)$ is
\begin{equation}\label{Property1}
  \mathcal{L}[f^{(n)}(t)] = s^n\hat{f}(s) - \sum_{m=1}^ns^{m-1}f^{(n-m)}(0).
\end{equation}
Since we assert that $f(t)$ and its derivatives are of of exponential
type, we know that
\begin{equation}\label{Property2}
  \lim_{s \to \infty}\mathcal{L}[f^{(n)}(t)] = 0.
\end{equation}
Substituting eq (\ref{Property1}) into eq (\ref{Property2}) and then
rearranging the terms gives us a recursive formula for
$f^{(n)}(0)$ in terms of $\hat{f}(s)$:
\begin{equation}\label{NthDerivative}
  f^{(n)}(0) = 
  \begin{cases}
    \lim_{s \to \infty} \big( s\hat{f}(s)\big)\nonumber, &\text{if }n = 0\\
    \lim_{s \to \infty} \big( s^{n + 1}\hat{f}(s) - \sum_{m=0}^{n-1}
    s^{m+1}f^{(n-m-1)}(0)\big), &\text{if }n > 0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
We can use eq (\ref{NthDerivative}) to construct a Taylor series
expansion of $f(t)$ about $t=0$,
\begin{equation}
  f(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}t^n.
\end{equation}
Since $f^{(n)}(0)$ can be expressed entirely in terms of
$\hat f(s)$, evaluating the above series expansion is effectively the
same as performing an inverse Laplace transform on $\hat f(s)$.
